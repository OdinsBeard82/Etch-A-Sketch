Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch Playground! This project provides a dynamic browser-based canvas, allowing you to unleash your creativity in a pixelated world. With interactive grid creation and a vibrant hover effect, this Etch-A-Sketch invites you to explore the joy of digital sketching.

Features
Dynamic Grid Creation: Use JavaScript to generate a grid of square divs for artistic expression.

Hover Effect: Watch as colors come to life with a pixelated trail effect on grid divs.

User-Defined Grid: Customize your canvas by inputting the number of squares per side.

Usage
Open the HTML file in your browser.
Explore the Etch-A-Sketch by moving the mouse over the grid.
Click "Refresh" to clear the grid and start anew.
Click "Restart" to prompt the user for a new grid size.
Implementation Details
The createGrid function dynamically generates the grid, while resetGrid enables users to input a new grid size.

Each grid square is assigned a random color on hover, offering an artistic and interactive experience.

Flexbox is utilized for visual organization of the grid.

Feel free to delve into the code for a deeper understanding and unleash your creativity on this Etch-A-Sketch playground!

Extra Credit
Challenge yourself with the following tasks:

Randomized RGB Colors: Transform the behavior of a square by randomizing its RGB color entirely with each interaction.

Technologies Used
JavaScript for dynamic grid creation and hover effects.
Happy sketching!
